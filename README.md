# Odin Recipes

## About the project

The Odin Recipes Project is a part of The Odin Project Curriculum.

For this project, I built an HTML website to understand and practice how HTML works and what I can do with this technology.

## What I learned

The project involves building a recipe website with a home page (index) and four recipe pages where users can navigate from the home page to the recipe pages.

What I learned from building this project?
How to add images to an HTML website
How to link pages
How to create ordered lists
How to create unordered lists
How to structure files 
How to use tags properly in an HTML file
