        <h2>Chicken and Mushrooms Ingredients</h2>
        <p>This chicken and mushrooms recipe video is an experiment in extreme self-control; <br>I wanted to challenge myself to make a chicken and mushrooms recipe using only chicken and mushrooms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 chicken breast halves, boneless, skin-on</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to prepare the chicken and mushrooms</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season chicken on all sides with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in an ovenproof skillet. <br>Place chicken skin-side down in skillet and cook until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn chicken over; stir mushrooms with a pinch of salt into skillet. <br>Increase heat to high; cook, stirring mushrooms occasionally, until mushrooms shrink slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). <br>Transfer chicken breasts to a plate and loosely tent with foil; set aside.</li>
            <li>Set skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat; cook and stir mushrooms until brown bits start to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. <br>Pour water into the skillet, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan. <br>Cook until water is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in any accumulated juices from the chicken into the skillet. Stir butter into mushroom mixture, <br>stirring constantly until butter is completely melted and incorporated.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper. Spoon mushroom sauce over chicken and serve.</li>
        </ol>
